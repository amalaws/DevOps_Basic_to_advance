In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, Docker has emerged as a cornerstone technology, dramatically changing how developers build, package, and deploy applications. By leveraging containerization, Docker offers a solution to the long-standing problem of “it works on my machine,” enabling consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

## **🤷‍♂️What Is Docker?**

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers encapsulate an application and all of its dependencies, ensuring it runs the same regardless of the underlying infrastructure. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host system’s operating system, making them more efficient in terms of system resources and speed.

## **🤔How Docker Works**

Docker uses a client-server architecture:

* **Docker Client**: The interface used to interact with Docker.
    
* **Docker Daemon**: The background service that manages Docker images, containers, networks, and storage.
    
* **Docker Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers.
    
* **Docker Containers**: Executable instances of Docker images.
    

Developers define application environments using a `Dockerfile`, a script containing instructions to assemble a Docker image. Once built, this image can be shared and deployed consistently across different environments.

## **⚡Key Benefits of Docker**

1. **Portability**: Docker containers can run anywhere — on a developer’s laptop, on-premise servers, or cloud platforms — as long as Docker is installed.
    
2. **Consistency**: Docker eliminates environment discrepancies between development and production.
    
3. **Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight, start up quickly, and use fewer resources than traditional virtual machines.
    
4. **Scalability**: Docker integrates seamlessly with orchestration tools like Kubernetes, making it easier to scale applications.
    
5. **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own isolated environment, improving security and stability.
    

## **👌Common Use Cases**

* **Microservices architecture**: Docker makes it easier to build and manage applications made of loosely coupled services.
    
* **CI/CD pipelines**: Docker is often used to automate building, testing, and deployment processes.
    
* **Hybrid cloud deployments**: Containers simplify moving applications between different cloud environments.
    

## 📚Task to be performed

### :: ● **Pull ubuntu container**

### ● Run this container, and map port 80 on the local

### ● Install apache2 on this container

### ● Check if you are able to access the apache page on your browser Pull ubuntu container

### **1\. Pull Ubuntu Container**

In your terminal, run:

```bash
docker pull ubuntu
```

---

### ✅ **2\. Run the Container and Map Port 80**

Run the container in **interactive mode**, map **container's port 80** to **your local port 80**, and open a shell:

```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 ubuntu /bin/bash
```

> This command does:
> 
> * `-it`: runs interactively so you can type commands
>     
> * `-p 80:80`: maps local port 80 to container's port 80
>     
> * `ubuntu`: uses the Ubuntu image
>     
> * `/bin/bash`: opens a bash shell inside the container
>     

---

### ✅ **3\. Install Apache2**

Once you're inside the container shell, run the following:

```bash
apt update
apt install apache2 -y
```

Then start the Apache server:

```bash
apachectl start
```

---

### ✅ **4\. Check in Browser**

Now, open your web browser and go to:

```bash
http://localhost
```

You should see the **Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page**, meaning it's working!

## **Conclusion**

Docker has redefined the way applications are developed and delivered. Its ability to streamline workflows, reduce overhead, and ensure consistency makes it an indispensable tool in modern DevOps practices. As organizations increasingly adopt cloud-native technologies, Docker continues to be a foundational element in the software development lifecycle.
